        <p class="fpara">"I believe that we can create a poverty-free world because poverty is not created by poor people. It has been created and sustained by the economic and social systems that we have designed for ourselves; the institutions and concepts that make up that system; the policies that we pursue.
            Poverty is unnecessary and can be eliminated. It is not caused by the actions of the poor but by flaws in systems, concepts, and institutions that shape the economy and society. We can design a new world free of poverty and injustice, built on fairness, innovation, and human dignity for all.    "</p>
